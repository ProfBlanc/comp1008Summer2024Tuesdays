String data is wasteful
String data is technically a Reference data type
    but behaves like a primitive data type

String s = new String(); => possible

String s = "hello world";

int num = 100;

We could use it as a pure Reference data type
    most developers do not


Anytime that we update a string (change the content)
    Destroying the previously decelared String variable
    Creating a new string variable, putting new contents as value


String s = "hello world";
s = "hi, there";

//Creating String variable named s => "Hello World"
//destroying String variable named s, creating a new Object
// called String s=> "hi, there"


StringBuilder class
A true Reference data type
    Instantiated and used like an object
Is mutable
Like a waterbottle
    a capacity
        soft capacity
            auto-increases
                previous capacity + 1, doubled


REGularEXpressions
advanced searching for text

a word that contains two e's following by an n

text that contains two e's following by
either n, m, l


Special Characters => special means

Position

^   at start
$   at end

^ben    text starts with ben

you$    text ends with you

Ranges
[a-z]   contains letters a-z inclusive
[aeiou] contains either a, e, i, o, u
()      group, execute this first, literal text

[^a-z]  does NOT contain letters a-z
[^aeiou] does NOT contain neither a, e, i, o, u

[0-9]   contains numbers 0-9

Repetition

{N}     Repeat N times
e{2}[nlm]
    e repeated exactly twice, following by n, l or m (once
        been, feel, etc
{N,}    Repeated at least N times
    e{2,}[nlm]
        beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen,
        feeeeeel,
        deeeeeeeeeem
{N,M} between N and M times
    e{2,5}[nlm]
        will match
            been, beeeeen, beeeen,
        Not match
            beeeeeen

Short-cut Repetition

?       zero or 1 times
    {0,1}
+       one or many times
    {1,}
*       zero or many times
    {0,}

.   Matches any letter
^b.+n$
    text starts with b, has at least 1 character afterwards. Ends in n

Short-cut Regex Expressions

\d      any digit
    [0-9]
\w      any word
    [a-zA-Z_]
\s      whitespace
    [\t\n\r ]

\D   not any digit
    [^0-9]
\W   not a word
    [^a-zA-Z_]
\S  not whitespace




Exceptions
    The program did not end properly

    Exception COULD happend using
        accepting user input
        opening internal resources
            files, folders, image,etc
        connecting to external resources
            database
            api
    Exceptions are not the same as syntax errors

    Try-Catch blocks
        attempting to run a code that falls under above categories
        EXCEPT an error => NO technical difficulties
