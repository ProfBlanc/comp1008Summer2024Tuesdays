Polymorphism
    Poly = multiple
    morphism = body, forms, version

A class/entity
    can use component from another entity

Two types of compoenent
    internal = computer chips
        abstract classes

    external = screen
        interfaces

charecteritics of internal components
    NOT useful by itself
        needs to be part of an entity
            incomplete class

    abstract classes CANNOT be instantiated
    abstract classes are dedicated parent class

    What things can be included in abstract
        constructors
        methods
        instance variable
        constants
            EVERYTHING that a Concrete class
            has, an abstract class can have

    An abstract class CAN have an abstract method
        is an incomplete method => a method declare but not implement
            has no method body. no braces with statements inside


    Define a Shape

    Define an abstract method


Interface
    external component of a class
    a list of requirements that the class must implement
    only has method declarations
        no instance variable, constructors, methods.
        ONLY method declaration => force sub-class to implement
        these requirements
    tends to define requirements/methods that INTERACT with USER

A Concrete class can have a max of 1 parent class
    another concrete class
    or an abstract class
A Concrete class can have multiple Interfaces

Can an abstract class extend another abstract class?  YES

Game part 1
Me: State an object
You: Tell me if object is good candidate for
    Concrete class
    Abstract class
    Interface

q1) Is this object functional by itself?
        Y: concrete
        N: go to question 2

q2) Is this component an internal component of a bigger object or external
        internal: abstract class
        external: interface

Human/Person        concrete
Laptop              concrete
Car                 concrete
Bike                concrete
Backpack            concrete or interface
Home                concrete

Hair                interface

Door                interface
Steering Wheel      interface


Game part 2

Me: State a component
You: Say whether this component can be implemented in
    Concrete
    Abstract
    interface

Instance Variable:      Concrete    Abstract
Constant Values:        Concrete    Abstract    Interface
Constructors            Concrete    Abstract
Regular Method          concrete    abstract
abstract methods        abstract    interface
